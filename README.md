#### -- Project status : Active

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to clean and explore a survey dataset. <br>
Survey datasets are, while very common, easy to get 'dirty' thus difficult to clean for machine learning projects. <br>
By cleaning and exploring the survey dataset, the author wants to have solid confidence in his data cleaning skills and prepare dataset to build future machine learning projects on.
